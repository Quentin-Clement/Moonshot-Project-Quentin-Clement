## 1. Introduction

## 1.1 The problem

Since my earliest childhood, sport has been a massive pillar of my life. And with time, the hobby became a real ambition of performance. \
To achieve my goals, I had to get the most out of my body while preventing injury. On that task, I was helped by coaches who taught me the right techniques and the right exercises to mix performance and safety. 

<br>

Unfortunately, I never went to the Olympics but at least I never got seriously injured. Time flies and for a few years, I started to go to the gym. \
This time, I didn't have a coach and I had to learn by myself. Quickly, the first pains and injuries appeared while my progresses were on the ups and downs. It didn't took me long to understand that my problem was the lack of technique. I would have love to have a coach but I couldn't afford it.

<br>

But then, <u> **How to to correct my technique without a coach?** </u>

### 1.2 The solution

At first you can ask people at your gym to give you advice or watch videos on the internet. But it's not always easy to find someone who knows what he's talking about and the internet is full of contradictory information. \
So I thought about a solution. Compare your technique to the one of international athletes.

<u> **But how?** </u> \
An app that will ask you to film yourself while doing an exercise and then compare your video to a whole database of international athletes. It will detect your mistakes and give you advice to correct them.

## 2. Project Scope

### 2.1 The Application

#### ‚û≠ <u> 2.1.1 The Marketplace </u>

Following the technology choice of using Swift, the app will be only available on the Apple Store. 
> *‚ùóÔ∏è Depending on the users feedback, we might consider a portage to Android.* 

#### ‚û≠ <u> 2.1.2 The Features </u>

The application will be fluid and user-friendly to fullfil UI and UX requirements. It will contain two main features:
- An AI that will analyse your video and offer feedback to refine your technique.
- A follow-up on your previous injuries with a set of exercises and warm-ups tailored to address any recurring pains or vulnerable body parts.

#### ‚û≠ <u> 2.1.3 Included Advertising </u>

One of the biggest challenge will be to include advertising in the app. It will be necessary to find a way to make it non-intrusive and to not affect the user experience.

### 2.2 The Artificial Intelligence

#### ‚û≠ <u> 2.2.1 The Database </u>

The AI will be trained using a database of videos featuring international powerlifting athletes as well as a database of videos demonstrating various incorrect techniques.
> *üí° As many as possible for each movement to detect all kind of mistakes.* 

To begin, we'll concentrate on the three key movements of powerlifting: **Squat**, **Bench Press** and **Deadlift**. 

#### ‚û≠ <u> 2.2.2 The Output </u>

When the AI has finished analysing the video, it will output a list of mistakes.
The output will be a basic error message saying which part(s) of the movement is incorrect but without precising why it's incorrect. \
An example of output would be: "Wrong back position".
> *üîÆ Depending on the evolution of the project and of the complexity, the goal would be to have a generative AI that will provide more details on the mistake you are making. \
> For instance: "Your back isn't sufficiently arched, ending up minimising the impact of your leg drive."*
