# Outfinder-ALGOSUP

Here is the repository dedicated to **Quentin CLÃ‰MENT**'s moonshot project in **ALGOSUP**. <br>
The name of the project is **Outfinder**. <hr>
For my scholarship, I have to develop a project in 5 years in order to improve my skills in computer science but also to show my futur level at the end of this project. <br>

## 1. What is Outfinder ?

Outfinder is an application. It is divided into two parts : <br>
- The first part is basically a mobile application. <br> 
- The second part is an AI that will be included in the mobile application and connected to Instagram.<br> 

As you can guess with the name of the project, the application is about finding outfits. To be precise, it is about finding outfits that match the user's sneakers. 

How the application works will be divided in multiple steps:
- Firstly, the user will enter the brand and the model of his sneakers in the application. <br>
- Secondly, the AI will search in Instagram the photos where these sneakers appear. <br>
- Thirdly, the AI will search in these photos the references of the clothes in each photo. <br>
- To finish, the application will return to the user the photos where his sneakers appear and the references of the clothes found in them. <br>
- Optionally, the user will be able to directly go the the website of the clothes found in the photos. <br>

## 2. The application development

The application development in itself seems to be the easiest part of this project, it's a field I really enjoy and I have a little experience in it (I expect to have a lot more experience in 5 years by doing other web projects with the school). <br>

Then, for the design of the website is not something I really care at the moment but it will be REALLY important if I want to bring users to the application. The design is not something I'm good at but I have contacts in this field and they will help me to choose the best design for the application in order to make it as attractive and user-friendly as possible. <br>

Another point is the hosting of the application. It is something I am more apprehensive about because I didn't work on it yet. That's something I expect to work in the school during the rest of my scholarship and if it's not the case I will have to work on it by myself. <br>

At last, I will have to care about the security part of the application. I will have to make sure that the user's data is safe and that the user can't access to the data of other users. It's the most important part in the application of the development so I will have to be very cautious in order to avoid any security breach. I will test the security as much as possible but also ask people to test it and try to break it. <br>

## 3. The AI development

The AI development is the most important part of the project. It is the part that will make the difference between a good project and a great project. <br>

AI is a very complex field and I don't have a lot of experience in it. I will have to create my model from scratch and I will have to work on it for a long time. I will train it with as much data as possible (this data will be Instagram photos that I will have to collect and filter myself). I will then have to test it and either improve it by modifying the model or by adding more training data. <br>

To provide to the user the best experience possible, I will have to make the AI search in the Instagram database for each sneakers. When the user enter his model in the application, it will return the result of the search that is been made before by the AI Searching in the whole Instagram database is a very long process I can't do with my own computer, I will have to pay for other computers to do it. <br>

In addition to be very long, it will also be very expensive. I can't afford that ammount of money that's why I'm searching for sponsors/partners. <br>

## 4. Partnerships

I will have to do a business plan in order to know how much money I will need to develop the project. <br>

I'm currently looking for partnerships with brands making sneakers. It could be a good way for them to promote their brand and their products by combining fashion and social networks, two fields very developped for the young audience. In my opinion it's a very profitable market for them. Expanding further in this sector would undoubtedly allow them to make profits. <br>

I'm sure that some brands will be interested in this project and will be ready to help me to develop it but unfortunately I don't have any contacts in this field and it's really complicated to contact them to discuss about a partnership. <br>

## 2. What to do for the first version ?

Find one partner and one model of this brand to start building my model. <br>
Build the model, train it and test it. Make the AI search in the whole Instagram database (the most time-consuming step). <br> 
Build a short application and connect it to the AI. <br>

## 3. What should be the biggest challenges to overcome ?

In my opinion there are three main challenges to overcome : <br>
- The first one is the AI. As I previously said, it is the most important part of the project but it's also the most complex, long and expensive part of this project. I'm not very competent in this field and I will have to learn a lot of things in order to be able to build a good model. <br>
- The second one is the business plan, I need to evaluate the cost of this project but also how much I estimate it will generate in the future. I don't have any experience in this field so either I will learn it by myself or I will have to find someone who can help me with this part of the project. <br>
- The thid one is finding a partner. I don't have any experience in business and marketing, it seems very complicated to contact a brand and to discuss about a partnership around this project. <br>
